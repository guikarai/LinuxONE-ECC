# RSA pubic key activities

In this section, let's test performance of RSA in very different conditions. First of all, we will generate key pairs using RSA with different size of RSA key. Then we will use generated RSA keys to sign a pdf file, and to verify the digital signature of this pdf file. To conclude we will generate according RSA keys RSA digital certificate complying with x509. 

## RSA performance table

RSA Key size in bits | Key generation in seconds |  Digital signature in seconds  | Signature verification in seconds  | Certificate generation in seconds | TLS Handshakes

RSA 1024     | | | | |
RSA 2048     | | | | |
RSA 3072     | | | | |
RSA 4096     | | | | |
RSA 7680     | | | | |
