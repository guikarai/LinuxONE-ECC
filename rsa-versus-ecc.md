# RSA versus ECC performance

## Performance summary
In previous section, you tested the RSA and the ECC performance. You probably understood already how fast ECC is.

Let's conclude together about your findings. Please reports your test measured performance in the two following tables:

RSA Key size in bits | Key generation in seconds |  Digital signature in seconds  | Signature verification in seconds  | Certificate generation in seconds
------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------
RSA 1024     | | | |
RSA 2048     | | | |
RSA 3072     | | | |
RSA 4096     | | | |
RSA 7680     | | | |
RSA 15360    | | | |


ECC Key size in bits | Key generation in seconds |  Digital signature in seconds  | Signature verification in seconds  | Certificate generation in seconds
------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------
prime256v1    | | | |
secp384r1     | | | |
secp521r1     | | | |

Let's simplified thise tables with the following table:

RSA Key size in bits | ECC Key size in bits |  Key size factor  | Key generation factor | Signature verification factor  | Certificate generation factor
------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------
RSA 3072 | prime256v1    | | | |
RSA 4096 | secp384r1     | | | |
RSA 7680 | secp521r1     | | | |

**Note:**
* Key size factor = RSA key size / ECC key size
* Key generation factor = RSA Key generation in seconds / ECC Key generation in seconds
* Digital signature = RSA Digital signature in seconds / ECC Digital signature in seconds
* Signature verification factor = RSA Signature verification in seconds / ECC Signature verification in seconds
* Certificate generation factor = RSA Certificate generation in seconds / ECC Certificate generation in seconds

## ECC and Hardware Acceleration

Even if there is no crypto cards configured, the LinuxONE server speed up ECC operations. This is thanks to CPACF that speed up SHA activity as required for the digital signature, and SIMD that speed up ECC operations.

Let see how much crypto activity we generated together during this hands-on lab by issuing the following command:
```

Congratulations, this ends the hands-on lab about LinuxONE and ECC.
