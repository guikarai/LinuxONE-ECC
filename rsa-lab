## Enabling OpenSSL and openSSH to use the Hardware
This chapter describes how to use the cryptographic functions of the LinuxONE to encrypt data in flight. This technique means that the data is encrypted and decrypted before and after it is transmitted. We will use OpenSSL, SCP and SFTP to demonstrate the encryption of data in flight.
This chapter also shows how to customize the product to use the LinuxONE hardware encryption features. This chapter includes the following sections:
- Preparing to use OpenSSL
- Configuring OpenSSL
- Testing Hardware Crypto functions with OpenSSL
- Testing Hardware Crypto functions with SCP
- Testing Hardware Crypto functions with SFTP

#### Preparing to use OpenSSL
In the Linux system you use, OpenSSL is already instlaled, and the system is already enabled to use the cryptographic hardware of the LinuxONE. We also loaded the cryptographic device driver and the libica 3.0 package to use the crypto hardware. For the following, the following packages are required for encryption:
- openssl
- openssl098e
- openssl-libs
- openssl-ibmca

During the installation of RHEL 7.4, the package openssl-ibmca was not automatically
installed and needs to be installed manually. Please issue the following command:
```
[root@ghrhel74crypt ~]# yum install openssl-ibmca
```
Now all needed packages are successfully installed. At this moment only the default engine of OpenSSL is available. To check it, please issue the following command:
```
[root@ghrhel74crypt ~]# openssl engine -c
(dynamic) Dynamic engine loading support
```
#### Configuring OpenSSL
